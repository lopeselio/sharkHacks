### What we are looking to implement:

1. Implementing a news section wherein people get daily updates about trends in medicine, by calling an external API.

2. Implementing Speech to text system wherin we can leverage Natural Language Processing techniques and tools like Facebook's Wit.ai to capture the intent of the doctors communicated message and update patient records in medical prescription, surgery, patient history, along with the timestamp, wherein doctors don't have to spend time writing patient records on paper/documents but it can be updated using Speech to Text.
